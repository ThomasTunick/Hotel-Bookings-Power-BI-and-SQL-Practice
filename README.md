This Project was to practice using Power BI and SQL
Using SQL I exctracted and cleaned the hotel booking data. I was able to analyse revenue and booking trends
Using Power BI I was able to visualize key metrics and trends
Used Power BI, SQL, and DAX but wasn't able to get the DAX queries
First time using Power BI which is why it kind of looks simple was just playing around with what data I could pull and what filters and visualizations I could use.
# Useful Data
August had the highest total revenue.
The TA/TO (Travel Agent/Tour Operator) channel had the most bookings but also a 22.83% cancellation rate.
Undefined channels had 80%+ cancellation rate, suggesting data issues or guest intent.
The average daily rate across all bookings was â‚¬101.83.
